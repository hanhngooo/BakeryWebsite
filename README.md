## :full_moon: :cake: BEP BANH LEKKER - BAKERY STORE :cake: :full_moon:

This project is built for my friend's family bakery store, my very first client :fire:. At the moment, the MVP website is used as a landing page for information about products and prices. This is a work in progress since the owner wants to expand it into an e-commerce website in near future.

In this project, I aim to pratice:

- Practice styling with flex box and responsive CSS
- Practice disciplined git usage with proper commits
